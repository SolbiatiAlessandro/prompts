Help me write a weekly review facebook post for the work I have done.
The facebook post should
- be in markdown
- have bullet points
- have emojis
- have a next steps section at the end
- be succint
- be optimised for engagement
- have a thanks section at the end


This an example weekly review, use the same format, but don't reuse any of these informations.
